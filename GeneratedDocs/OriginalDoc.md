## 2. Interfaces
- RESTful APIs
- SOAP-based services
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication
- Azure services such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure Service Bus

## 3. Use Cases

### 3.1 Good Use Cases
- **API Monetization:** Enabling developers to expose APIs for third-party access and monetize them.
- **API Gateway:** Acting as a front door for all APIs, providing centralized management and security.
- **API Versioning:** Supporting multiple versions of an API to ensure backward compatibility.
- **B2B Integration:** Facilitating secure and scalable integration between business partners.

### 3.2 Bad Use Cases
- **File Storage:** Not designed to serve as a file storage solution or content delivery network.
- **Heavy Data Processing:** Unsuitable for executing long-running or compute-intensive workloads.
- **Direct Database Access:** Should not be used as a direct interface for database operations.

## 4. Security Best Practice

### 4.1 Roles
- **API Administrator:** Manages API lifecycle and enforces policies.
- **API Developer:** Develops and maintains APIs and their configurations.
- **API Consumer:** Accesses APIs to integrate with applications.

### 4.2 Security
Azure API Management adopts a security-first approach, ensuring that APIs are protected from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities. It supports various authentication protocols and provides built-in security features like IP filtering and SSL termination.

#### 4.2.1 Data Sensitivity
Azure API Management can handle data with varying sensitivity levels, ranging from public to highly confidential. The following table outlines configuration settings to manage data sensitivity:

| Data Sensitivity Level | Configuration Setting                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Public                 | Enable IP whitelisting and SSL termination.       |
| Internal               | Implement OAuth 2.0 and API key authentication.   |
| Confidential           | Enforce JWT validation and role-based access.     |
| Highly Confidential    | Use VNET integration and data encryption at rest. |

## 5. Summary
Azure API Management offers a robust platform for managing APIs, providing features such as traffic management, security, and analytics. It is well-suited for e-commerce applications, enabling seamless integration and secure access to APIs. By adhering to best practices and understanding its limitations, organizations can effectively leverage Azure API Management to enhance their API strategy and drive business value.
