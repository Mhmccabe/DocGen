## 2. Interfaces

- Azure APIs
- Custom APIs
- Azure Active Directory
- On-premises services through Hybrid Connections or Azure Virtual Network

## 3. Use Cases

### 3.1 Good Use Cases

- **API Monetization:** Enable organizations to package and sell APIs to partners and external developers.
- **Multi-channel Retail:** Facilitate consistent API delivery across web, mobile, and IoT devices.
- **Partner Integration:** Securely expose internal APIs to partners to streamline supply chain and logistics operations.

### 3.2 Bad Use Cases

- **Non-HTTP Protocols:** Azure API Management is not designed for protocols outside of HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Complex ETL Operations:** Not suited for handling complex data transformation and loading tasks typically managed by data integration tools.
- **High-Frequency Real-Time Messaging:** Inefficient for scenarios requiring extremely low-latency message delivery.

## 4. Security Best Practices

### 4.1 Roles

- **API Administrator:** Manages API configurations, policies, and lifecycle.
- **Developer:** Consumes APIs and builds applications using the provided APIs.
- **Security Administrator:** Oversees security configurations and ensures compliance with security policies.

### 4.2 Security

Azure API Management provides industry-standard security measures, including authentication, authorization, and transport-level security. Policies such as IP filtering, rate limiting, and request validation enhance the security posture.

#### 4.2.1 Data Sensitivity

Azure API Management can handle various data sensitivity levels with appropriate configuration settings.

| Data Sensitivity Level | Configuration Setting                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low                    | Basic authentication, no IP filtering, open access through developer portal            |
| Medium                 | OAuth 2.0 authentication, IP whitelisting, API key restrictions                        |
| High                   | Azure AD authentication, JWT validation, strict rate limiting, and logging enabled     |

## 5. Summary

Azure API Management provides a comprehensive framework for managing APIs, ensuring secure, scalable, and reliable API delivery. It is best suited for scenarios involving API monetization, multi-channel delivery, and partner integration in the E-Commerce sector, while it should be avoided for non-HTTP protocols, complex ETL operations, and high-frequency real-time messaging. With robust security features and role-based access, it ensures that data and services are protected while being easily accessible to authorized users.
