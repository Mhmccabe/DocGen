# Azure API Management Component Standard (Revised)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

Azure API Management is a robust, scalable platform for managing APIs. It helps organizations publish, secure, and analyze their APIs, allowing internal, partner, and external developers to unlock the potential of their data and services. This component is essential for creating consistent and modern API gateways for existing back-end services.

|                 |                     | Security            | Implements authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWT validation), authorization, IP filtering, and integrates with Azure AD for secure access, supporting separation of concerns. |
|                 | Developer Portal    | API Documentation   | Automatically generates interactive API documentation and testing environments for developers.                                                   |
|                 |                     | User Management     | Manages API consumer identities and access through customizable developer portals.                                                               |
|                 | Analytics & Insights| Usage Analytics     | Provides insights into API usage, performance, and user behavior through detailed analytics and reporting.                                       |
|                 |                     | Log Monitoring      | Allows for real-time logging and monitoring of APIs to track performance and troubleshoot issues.                                                |
|                 |                     | Integration         | Seamlessly integrates with other Azure services such as Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Application Insights for comprehensive API management.  |

## 2. Interfaces

- Azure APIs
- Custom APIs
- Azure Active Directory
- On-premises services through Hybrid Connections or Azure Virtual Network
- Integration with Azure Functions, Logic Apps, Application Insights

## 3. Use Cases

### 3.1 Good Use Cases

- **API Monetization:** Enable organizations to package and sell APIs to partners and external developers.
- **Multi-channel Retail:** Facilitate consistent API delivery across web, mobile, and IoT devices.
- **Partner Integration:** Securely expose internal APIs to partners to streamline supply chain and logistics operations.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Leverage API Management to orchestrate microservices, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

### 3.2 Bad Use Cases

- **Non-HTTP Protocols:** Azure API Management is not designed for protocols outside of HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Complex ETL Operations:** Not suited for handling complex data transformation and loading tasks typically managed by data integration tools.
- **High-Frequency Real-Time Messaging:** Inefficient for scenarios requiring extremely low-latency message delivery.

## 4. Security Best Practices

### 4.1 Roles

- **API Administrator:** Manages API configurations, policies, and lifecycle.
- **Developer:** Consumes APIs and builds applications using the provided APIs.
- **Security Administrator:** Oversees security configurations and ensures compliance with security policies, integrating with Inspection services for internet traffic monitoring.

### 4.2 Security

Azure API Management provides industry-standard security measures, including authentication, authorization, and transport-level security. Policies such as IP filtering, rate limiting, and request validation enhance security, with integration to PenCo's Inspection service for comprehensive monitoring.

#### 4.2.1 Data Sensitivity

Azure API Management can handle various data sensitivity levels with appropriate configuration settings to ensure compliance with standards such as GDPR.

| Data Sensitivity Level | Configuration Setting                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low                    | Basic authentication, no IP filtering, open access through developer portal            |
| Medium                 | OAuth 2.0 authentication, IP whitelisting, API key restrictions                        |
| High                   | Azure AD authentication, JWT validation, strict rate limiting, logging enabled, and encryption practices such as TLS for data in transit |

## 5. Summary

Azure API Management offers a comprehensive framework for managing APIs, ensuring secure, scalable, and reliable API delivery. It excels in API monetization, multi-channel delivery, partner integration, and microservices architecture, while it should be avoided for non-HTTP protocols, complex ETL operations, and high-frequency real-time messaging. By integrating with PenCo's Inspection service and leveraging other Azure services, it provides a robust solution for API management that aligns with PenCo's security and architectural strategies. Regular updates and detailed architectural patterns will further enhance its utility for solution architects.
