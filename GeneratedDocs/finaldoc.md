# Azure API Management Component Standard

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview
Azure API Management (APIM) is a robust API gateway platform designed to manage APIs across diverse environments securely, efficiently, and at scale. APIM enhances API lifecycle management by enabling the creation, publication, maintenance, monitoring, and securing of APIs, while providing seamless integration capabilities with various backend services and systems.

## 2. Interfaces
- REST APIs
- SOAP APIs
- WebSocket
- GraphQL
- Azure Services (e.g., Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps)
- On-premises systems via Azure VPN or ExpressRoute

## 3. Use Cases

### 3.1 Good Use Cases
- Centralized management of APIs for an e-commerce platform, allowing for consistent policy enforcement and security.
- Providing a developer portal for third-party developers to access, test, and integrate with e-commerce APIs.
- Implementing API rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage among partners and customers.

### 3.2 Bad Use Cases
- Directly serving static content like images or files without leveraging a dedicated Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- Hosting APIs that require extremely low latency communication, such as high-frequency trading systems, where APIM may introduce additional overhead.
- Using APIM for non-API related traffic, such as raw database queries or file transfers.

## 4. Security Best Practice

### 4.1 Roles
- **API Administrator**: Manages APIs, policies, and security settings.
- **Developer**: Consumes APIs and interacts with the developer portal.
- **Security Officer**: Oversees security configurations and compliance.

### 4.2 Security Overview
Azure APIM enforces robust security measures across all APIs, including rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and OAuth 2.0. It is crucial to ensure all internet access routes through an Inspection service to adhere to the principle of prohibiting direct internet access.

#### Configuration Settings
- Enable OAuth 2.0 for all APIs to ensure secure authentication and authorization.
- Implement IP whitelisting for sensitive APIs to restrict access to trusted networks.
- Set up detailed logging for auditing and monitoring purposes.
- Use Azure Private Link to ensure traffic between APIM and backend services does not traverse the public internet.

### 4.2.1 Data Sensitivity

| Data Sensitivity Level | Description                                    | Configuration Setting                                   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Low                    | Publicly accessible data                       | Relaxed rate limiting, no IP restrictions               |
| Medium                 | Internal business data                         | Moderate rate limiting, OAuth 2.0, IP whitelisting      |
| High                   | Sensitive customer or financial data           | Strict rate limiting, OAuth 2.0, IP whitelisting, encryption, Private Link, logging enabled |

## 5. Summary
Azure API Management provides a powerful platform for managing APIs in a secure, scalable, and efficient manner. It is particularly well-suited for e-commerce applications, offering capabilities like API gateway, security, and developer engagement. However, it should not be used for non-API traffic or scenarios requiring extremely low latency. By adhering to security best practices and leveraging the full suite of APIM features, organizations can effectively streamline their API management processes while ensuring data security and compliance. Architects should consider criteria such as multi-region API distribution needs and hybrid connectivity requirements when selecting APIM.
