## 2. Interfaces
- RESTful APIs
- SOAP-based services
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication
- Azure services such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure Service Bus
- Integration with PenCo's identity management systems for seamless authentication and authorization

## 3. Use Cases

### 3.1 Good Use Cases
- **API Monetization:** Enabling developers to expose APIs for third-party access and monetize them.
- **API Gateway:** Acting as a centralized management and security layer for all APIs, ensuring compliance with PenCo's governance policies.
- **API Versioning:** Supporting multiple versions of an API to ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions.
- **B2B Integration:** Facilitating secure and scalable integration between business partners, aligning with industry standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.

### 3.2 Bad Use Cases
- **File Storage:** Not designed to serve as a file storage solution or content delivery network.
- **Heavy Data Processing:** Unsuitable for executing long-running or compute-intensive workloads.
- **Direct Database Access:** Should not be used as a direct interface for database operations.

## 4. Security Best Practice

### 4.1 Roles
- **API Administrator:** Manages API lifecycle, enforces policies, and integrates with PenCo's inspection services.
- **API Developer:** Develops and maintains APIs, ensuring compliance with security and data sensitivity standards.
- **API Consumer:** Accesses APIs to integrate with applications, adhering to PenCo's security protocols.

### 4.2 Security
Azure API Management adopts a security-first approach, ensuring that APIs are protected from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities. It supports various authentication protocols and provides built-in security features like IP filtering and SSL termination. All internet access must go through PenCo's Inspection service to prevent direct internet exposure.

#### 4.2.1 Data Sensitivity
Azure API Management can handle data with varying sensitivity levels. The following table outlines configuration settings to manage data sensitivity, emphasizing encryption and VNET integration:

| Data Sensitivity Level | Configuration Setting                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Public                 | Enable IP whitelisting, SSL termination, and inspection service integration. |
| Internal               | Implement OAuth 2.0, API key authentication, and enforce data encryption in transit. |
| Confidential           | Enforce JWT validation, role-based access, and use of VNET integration.   |
| Highly Confidential    | Use VNET integration, data encryption at rest, and integrate with PenCo's monitoring tools. |

## 5. Summary
Azure API Management provides a robust platform for managing APIs, offering features such as traffic management, security, and analytics. It is well-suited for e-commerce applications within PenCo, enabling seamless integration and secure API access.
