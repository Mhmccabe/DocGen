# Architectural Document for Resilient Database

## 1. Introduction & Objectives

### Project Name: Resilient Database

The Resilient Database project aims to design and implement a highly resilient and scalable database component using MS SQL Server. This component will be integrated within a cloud-based architecture on AWS and managed through Python. The primary objectives are to ensure high availability, data integrity, security, and support for multi-user collaboration with real-time observability.

### Objectives:
- **Scalability**: Design the database to efficiently handle increased loads.
- **Security**: Implement comprehensive security measures to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Multi-user Collaboration**: Facilitate concurrent access and collaboration by multiple users.
- **Observability**: Provide monitoring and logging for system performance tracking and issue diagnosis.
- **Compliance with Industry Standards**: Adhere to the TOGAF architecture framework and microservices best practices.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The architecture of the Resilient Database is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, leveraging a microservices architecture and the resilience of AWS cloud services.

#### Key Components:
1. **User Interface Layer**: Access through web and mobile applications.
2. **API Gateway**: Serves as the single entry point for all client requests.
3. **Microservices Layer**: Includes services for authentication, data access, and observability.
4. **Database Layer**: MS SQL Server, deployed as Multi-AZ RDS instances on AWS for failover support and high availability.
5. **AWS Infrastructure**:
   - EC2 Instances for hosting services
   - S3 for backup and storage
   - AWS CloudWatch for monitoring
   - IAM for access management

## 3. System Components

### APIs
- **Authentication API**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Data Access API**: Facilitates CRUD operations on the database.
- **Observability API**: Provides endpoints for logging and monitoring access and performance metrics.

### Databases
- **MS SQL Server**: Chosen for its robustness and reliability, deployed on AWS RDS with high availability.

### Services
- **Authentication Service**: Ensures secure database access.
- **Data Access Service**: Manages data transactions with the database.
- **Observability Service**: Monitors and logs system activities and performance.

## 4. Design Patterns Used

- **Microservices Pattern**: Facilitates modularity and independent deployment of services.
- **Repository Pattern**: Provides data access abstraction, maintaining a clean separation of concerns.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Enhances system resilience by managing service failures gracefully.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Clarify its context, especially in a horizontally scalable architecture, to ensure efficient resource management.

## 5. Security & Performance Considerations

### Security
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit is encrypted using AES-256.
- **Access Control**: Managed through AWS IAM roles and policies.
- **Authentication**: Utilizes multi-factor authentication and OAuth 2.0 for secure access.
- **Network Security**: VPCs, security groups, and NACLs control traffic.

### Performance
- **Load Balancing**: AWS ELB distributes incoming traffic evenly across instances.
- **Caching**: AWS ElastiCache reduces database load by caching frequently accessed data.
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically adjusts resources based on traffic patterns.

## 6. Deployment Strategy

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implemented using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy.
- **Blue/Green Deployment**: Enables zero-downtime releases and easy rollback.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Managed with AWS CloudFormation for consistent environments.

## 7. Future Scalability Plans

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add instances to handle increased load.
- **Sharding**: Divide the database into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **Database Read Replicas**: Distribute load and enhance read performance.
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Utilize machine learning models for predictive load management.

## Additional Considerations

- **Observability Tools**: Consider AWS X-Ray or third-party solutions like Datadog for enhanced logging and monitoring.
- **TOGAF Compliance**: Map architecture principles or phases to align with the TOGAF framework.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Develop backup strategies and define RTO/RPO objectives for comprehensive disaster recovery planning.

By addressing these factors, the Resilient Database is equipped to adapt to new requirements and technologies, maintaining its resilience, scalability, and security.
